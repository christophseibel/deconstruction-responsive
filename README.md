## image.deconstruct() <br />
image.deconstruct() is a small tool built with matter.js and p5.js which enables you to deconstruct an image into rigid body blocks by drawing a selection.
the idea of this tool came to me when I saw [this tool](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwdNOb5Mt1U/?img_index=1) by patrik h√ºbner on his instagram page. I realise a lot of my projects and experiments with matter.js so I got really interested in developing this idea of selecting parts of an image further.

this tool is also the first p5.js sketch that I put online as a tool for everyone so this thing had to be responsive and work on most devices (which is propably gonna cause some more commits) I learned a lot about making the sketch window responsive while keeping the same image quality and resolution on all devices.

If you have made something cool with this tool, have problems with this website or wan't to ask me questions about the project, don't be shy and contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chrstphsbl) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/christoph_sbl/)

I also want to thank [luke van](https://lukevan.me) who pointed me in the right direction on how to implement image upload in p5.js.
